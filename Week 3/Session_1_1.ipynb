It predicts the next character (letter/symbol) based only on the 1 past character. This is like an extremely simple mobile keyboard auto-complete.\n","\n","\n","#### Tokens & Vocabulary\n","\n","The text is first \"tokenized\" by simply assigning the numbers 0-64 to the uppercase & lowercase letters of the English alphabet and punctuation symbols. This mapping is called vocabulary. Since there are 65 such unique tokens, the vocabulary size is 65.\n","\n","\n","#### Embedding Table\n","\n","The model has only one layer, called an \"embedding table\", that acts as a trainable lookup table. The embedding table is a (65 x 65) sized matrix.\n","\n","Let's say the past token is character \"C\" (uppercase C), which is assigned 15 in the vocabulary. When 15 is given as the input, the embedding table gives the 15th row, a vector of legnth 65 as the output. Each of the 65 elements in this output corresponds to the probability of the next token. If the 13th element has highest value, the output is 13 = \"A\".\n","\n","### Training\n","\n","We train on the \"Tiny Shakespeare\" dataset, that contains 40,000 lines of Shakespeare plays. Given each token, we let the model guess the next token and then calculate the cross-entropy loss: $-Σ t_i \\log(y_i)$, where $t_i$ is the ground truth (actual next token from dataset), and $y_i$ is the token predicted by the model.\n","\n","### Results\n","\n","We can see the loss reducing with training iterations, and the resulting model generates text that somewhat resembles actual text, not pure random strings. But the resulting text is incomprehensible, since this model is too simple.\n","\n","### Limitation\n","\n","This model only looks at a single past token to predict the next token, which makes it extremely short-sighted. This is equal to context window legnth of 1. We will improve on this in the next models."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"Hr63nefWmXIE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721054237123,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Mihiruth Sehara","userId":"09933473335315989515"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","from torch.nn import functional as F"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ngT-59G5m2TM"},"source":["### Hyperparameters"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"6kqCFiSLmztM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721054237123,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Mihiruth Sehara","userId":"09933473335315989515"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["B = 32 #
